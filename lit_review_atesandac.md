**Year of Publication:** 2025  

**Link/DOI:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10762

### Intro/Summary

AFlow is a framework for automatically generating and optimizing Agentic Workflows. It uses Monte Carlo tree search in a code-represented workflow space to find effective workflows, replacing manual development with machine effort.

### Approach

Variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search:

1. Selection â€“ Soft mixed-probability strategy balancing exploration and exploitation.
2. Expansion â€“ LLM modifies existing workflows to generate new candidates.
3. Evaluation â€“ Execute workflows and compute performance scores.
4. Backpropagation â€“ Update tree with performance feedback.

## ðŸ“° GNNs as Predictors of Agentic Workflow Performances

**Author(s):** Zhang et al.

**Year of Publication:** 2025 

**Link/DOI:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11301

### Intro/Summary
Proposes using GNNs as lightweight predictors of workflow performance by modeling workflows as computational graphs and proposes introduces FLOW-GNN, a GNN-based predictor.

### Approach
1. Workflows are modeled as graphs where nodes = agents, edges = task dependencies.
2. GNN encodes the workflow graph into a graph-level embedding
3. Task instruction is encoded into a dense vector
4. Graph and task embeddings are fused for performance prediction (binary success/failure).

#### Benchmark Construction (FLORA-Bench):

Curates workflows from optimization systems (G-Designer, AFLOW) and filters tasks for balanced difficulty.

Labels generated via LLM execution (unit tests for coding tasks for example).

### Dataset

## ðŸ“° MAS-ZERO: Designing Multi-Agent Systems with Zero Supervision

**Author(s):** Ke et al.

**Year of Publication:** 2025  

**Link/DOI:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14996

### Intro/Summary
Dynamically generates, evaluates, and refines MAS configurations for each specific problem instance. The system uses a special meta-agent that works during the time it's solving a problem. This meta-agent creates, checks, and improves the MAS setup for each specific task.

### Approach

MAS-ZERO works in two main steps.

1. Meta iterations:
    *  Meta-agent breaks the problem into smaller, easier sub-tasks, then it designs a specific MAS, to solve each sub-task using a set of pre-made building blocks
    *  Meta-Feedback: The meta-agent looks at the results from the smaller sub-tasks to see how well the current MAS design is working. It checks two things: "solvability"  and "completeness". This feedback helps the meta-agent make a better design in the next round.

2. Self Verification: After multiple meta-iterations, which produce multiple candidate answers, the meta-agent selects the most suitable outcome. It does this by first ranking answers based on frequency and then selecting the best answer from the remaining candidates.

### Dataset
* Benchmarked using SWE-bench-lite, GPQA, AIME24

## ðŸ“° EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows

**Author(s):** Wang et al.

**Year of Publication:** 2025 

**Link/DOI:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03616

### Intro/Summary

Open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows.


### Approach

The framework consists of layers:
1. **Agent Layer**: Each agent is a composition of an LLM, action modules, and memory components, supporting flexible, context-aware decision-making and tools.
2. **Workflow Layer**: Provides a structured way to build, orchestrate, and execute multi-agent workflows, which are modeled as a directed graph. It supports both a flexible WorkFlowGraph for complex task graphs and a simplified SequentialWorkFlowGraph for rapid prototyping
3. **Evolving Layer**: Consists of 3 main components:
    * **Agent Optimizer**: Refines agent prompts, tool configurations, and action strategies to enhance individual agent performance using optimizers like TextGrad and MIPRO.
    * **Workflow Optimizer**: Improves task decomposition and execution flow by adjusting the structure of the workflow graph using optimizers like AFlow.
    * **Memory Optimizer**: Its objective is to provide unstructured persistent memory modules that enable selective retention and priority based retrieval. Still under development.
4. **Evaluation Layer**: Provides a framework to systematically assess workflow performance using two components: a task-specific evaluator for domain-relevant metrics (e.g. F1 score for HotPotQA) and an LLM-based evaluator.

### Dataset
* Evaluated on HotpotQA, MBPP, MATH and GAIA datasets.

## Automated Design of Agentic Systems
**Author(s):** Hu et al.

**Year of Publication:** 2025  

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08435

### Intro/Summary
Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS) is a research area that aims to "automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways." They utilize an algorithm called "Meta Agent Search," which iteratively programs new agents and evaluate them. Supported by code languages being Turing-complete, the meta agent is able to create different agent systems that cover every possibility. This includes not only prompts but workflows and tool use as well.


### Approach

A multi-agent system setup is built to implement the "Meta Agent Search" algorithm. The setup consists of a relatively simple framework with agents only having a "forward" function which allows them to communicate messages with the other agents in the system. The algorithm is as follows:

1. The archive is (optionally) initialized with baseline agents such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Refine 

2. Conditioned on the archive, the meta agent designs a new agent by generating a high-level description of the new idea for an agentic system and then implementing it in code. The design then undergoes two self-reflection steps by the meta agent to ensure it is novel

3. The generated agent is evaluated using validation data from the target domain. If errors occur during evaluation, the meta agent performs a self-reflection step to refine the design, repeating this process up to five times if necessary

4. Finally, the agent is added to the archive along with its evaluation metrics, and the process continues with the updated archive until the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## GPTSwarm: Language Agents as Optimizable Graphs 


**Author(s):** Zhuge et al.

**Year of Publication:** 2024  

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16823

### Intro/Summary

GPTSwarm is an algorithm that converts multi-agent systems to computational graphs. The nodes are functionalities of the agents such as processing multimodal data or querying LLMs. Edges represent the data flow between these operations. The aim of this algorithm is to optimize both the nodes and edges of the graph. This is done by optimizing the prompts and making changes to the graph connectivity.

### Approach

1. Each agent is converted to a graph. The nodes include functionalities such as tool calls, function calls, LLM interactions, and more. Then these nodes are connected by edges which represent the execution topology.
2. A complex multi-agent system is formed as composite graphs (combining multiple graphs). Note that only DAGs are used for these composite graphs.
3. Given a function that maps a task to its utility, the goal is to optimize this graph. This is done by finding adding which edges maximizes utility. The search space is found by considering the set of all possible edges. Configurations that break the DAG property are excluded from this search space.
5. For this problem, continous optimization approach was taken due to complexity. Find the details on the paper
6. For each node, initialize an empty history set.
7. A random sample is executed on the graph. The history sets of the nodes are updated with the new input/context and output tuples.
8. According to the history, current prompt, and description of each node, their prompt is updated.
